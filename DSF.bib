	Abstract = {An isothermal denaturation kinetic method was devel- oped for identifying potential ligands of proteins and measuring their affinity. The method is suitable for find- ing ligands specific toward proteins of unknown func- tion and for large-scale drug screening. It consists of analyzing the kinetics of isothermal denaturation of the protein---with and without the presence of potential spe- cific ligands---as measured by long-wavelength fluores- cent dyes whose quantum yield increases when bound to hydrophobic regions exposed upon unfolding of the pro- teins. The experimental procedure was developed using thymidylate kinase and stromelysin as target proteins. The kinetics of thermal unfolding of both of these en- zymes were consistent with a pathway of two consecu- tive first-order rate-limiting steps. Reflecting the stabi- lizing effect of protein/ligand complexes, the presence of specific ligands decreased the value of the rate constants of both steps in a dose-dependent manner. The depen- dence of the rate constants on ligand concentration obeyed a simple binding isotherm, the analysis of which yielded an accurate equilibrium constant for ligand binding. The method was validated by comparing its results with those obtained under the same conditions by steady-state fluorescence spectroscopy, circular di- chroism, and uv spectrophotometry: The corresponding rate constants were comparable for each of the analyti- cal detection methods.},

@article{Boivin_2013,
	Abstract = {The efficient large scale production of recombinant proteins depends on the careful conditioning of the protein as it is isolated and purified to homogeneity. Low protein stability leads to low purification yields as a result of protein degradation, precipitation and folding instability. It is often necessary to go through several iterations of trial-and-error to optimize the homogeneity, stability and solubility of the protein sample. We have set up Thermofluor assays to identify customized protocols for the preparation and characterization of individual protein constructs. We apply a two-step approach: we first screen for glo- bal parameters, followed by a search for protein-specific additives. The first screen has been designed in such a way, that it is possible to discern global stability trends according to pH, salt concentration, buffer type and concentration. The second screen contains small molecules that can affect the folding, aggrega- tion state and solubility of the protein construct and also includes small molecules that specifically bind and stabilize proteins. The screens are designed to evaluate purification and storage protocols, and aim to provide hints to optimize these protocols. The home-made screens have been tested on more than 200 different protein constructs at the Sample Preparation and Characterization (SPC) facility at EMBL Ham- burg. We describe which RT-PCR machines can be adapted to perform Thermofluor assays, what are the necessary experimental conditions to set up a screen, some leads on how to interpret the data and we give several examples of Thermofluor applications beyond stability screens.},

	Abstract = {The stability and homogeneity of a protein sample is strongly influenced by the composition of the buffer that the protein is in. A quick and easy approach to identify a buffer composition which increases the stability and possibly the conformational homogeneity of a protein sample is the fluorescence-based thermal-shift assay (Thermofluor). Here, a novel 96-condition screen for Thermofluor experiments is presented which consists of buffer and additive parts. The buffer screen comprises 23 different buffers and the additive screen includes small-molecule additives such as salts and nucleotide analogues. The utilization of small-molecule components which increase the thermal stability of a protein sample frequently results in a protein preparation of higher quality and quantity and ultimately also increases the chances of the protein crystallizing.},

	Abstract = {The Thermofluor assay, also referred to as a thermal shift assay or differential scanning fluorescence (DSF), is a fast and simple method that is based upon high-throughput measurements of protein stability. The Thermofluor method can be performed on nearly all qPCR machines, meaning no special instrumentation is necessary, and can be used to validate the quality of protein preparations, screen for ligands or cofactors, and discover buffers and additives that maximize protein stability. This unit describes how to set up a Thermofluor method on several common models of qPCR instruments, how to prepare the samples for the assay, and how to run and analyze the resulting data. The unit also describes a 96-well screen to determine optimal buffer conditions for protein stability, which may assist in protein crystallization, and details the use of custom software, developed specifically for the analysis of data from Thermofluor screens.},

	Abstract = {Differential scanning fluorimetry (DSF) is a rapid and inexpensive screening method to identify low-molecular-weight ligands that bind and stabilize purified proteins. The temperature at which a protein unfolds is measured by an increase in the fluorescence of a dye with affinity for hydrophobic parts of the protein, which are exposed as the protein unfolds. A simple fitting procedure allows quick calculation of the transition midpoint; the difference in the temperature of this midpoint in the presence and absence of ligand is related to the binding affinity of the small molecule, which can be a low-molecular-weight compound, a peptide or a nucleic acid. DSF is best performed using a conventional real-time PCR instrument. Ligand solutions from a storage plate are added to a solution of protein and dye, distributed into the wells of the PCR plate and fluorescence intensity measured as the temperature is raised gradually. Results can be obtained in a single day.},

	Abstract = {The 3D structures of human therapeutic targets are enabling for drug discovery. However, their purification and crystallization remain rate determining. In individual cases, ligands have been used to increase the success rate of protein purification and crystallization, but the broad applicability of this approach is unknown. We implemented two screening platforms, based on either fluorimetry or static light scattering, to measure the increase in protein thermal stability upon binding of a ligand without the need to monitor enzyme activity. In total, 221 different proteins from humans and human parasites were screened against one or both of two sorts of small-molecule libraries. The first library comprised different salts, pH conditions, and commonly found small molecules and was applicable to all proteins. The second comprised compounds specific for protein families of particular interest (e.g., protein kinases). In 20 cases, including nine unique human protein kinases, a small molecule was identified that stabilized the proteins and promoted structure determination. The methods are cost-effective, can be implemented in any laboratory, promise to increase the success rates of purifying and crystallizing human proteins significantly, and identify new ligands for these proteins.},
