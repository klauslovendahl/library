	Abstract = {Triton X-114 temperature transition extraction has been considered to be a simple and cost-effective strategy to eliminate endotoxin from plasmid preparations. However, a repeated cooling--heating process may promote the degradation of plasmid DNA. Based on the finding that the cloud point of Triton X-114 solution increases substantially in the presence of small amounts of sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) and that electrolytes decrease the cloud point of Triton X-114--SDS solution drastically, we designed a Triton X-114 isothermal extraction method for removing endotoxin from plasmid samples and found that it has the same endotoxin removal efficiency when compared with the temperature transition extraction method.

	Abstract = {Endotoxin is an unwanted by product of recombinant proteins puriWed from Escherichia coli. The inherent toxicity of endotoxins makes their removal an important step for the proteins' application in several biological assays and for safe parenteral administration. The method described in this paper is a one-step protocol which is eVective at removing tightly bound endotoxin from over-expressed tagged proteins in E. coli. We combined aYnity chromatography with a non-ionic detergent washing step, to remove most of the endo- toxin contaminants from the end product. An endotoxin reduction of less than 4 to 0.2 EU mg{!'}1 was achieved with protein recovery close to a yield 100%. As this new protocol requires only one step to simultaneously purify tagged proteins and eliminate endotoxins, it repre- sents a substantial advantage in time, eVort, and expense.},

@article{Eon-Duval_2004,
	Abstract = {Anion-exchange is the most popular chromatography technique in plasmid DNA purification. However, poor resolution of plasmid DNA from RNA often results in the addition of bovine-derived ribonuclease (RNase) A to degrade RNA impurities which raises regulatory concerns for the production of pharmaceutical-grade plasmid DNA. Low capacity for plasmid of most commercial media is another issue affecting the suitability of anion-exchange chromatography for large-scale processing. This study reports the use of anion-exchange chromatography to remove RNA in an RNase-free plasmid purification process. Resolution was achieved through careful selection of adsorbent and operating conditions as well as RNA reduction steps before chromatography. Dynamic capacity for plasmid was significantly increased (to 3.0mg/ml) so that it is now possible to envisage the large-scale manufacturing of therapeutic-grade plasmid DNA in the absence of added RNase using anion-exchange chromatography as a polishing step.},

	Abstract = {Supercharged proteins are a class of engineered or naturally occurring proteins with unusually high positive or negative net theoretical charge. Both super- negatively and superpositively charged proteins exhibit a remarkable ability to withstand thermally or chemically induced aggregation. Superpositively charged proteins are also able to penetrate mammalian cells. Associating cargo with these proteins, such as plasmid DNA, siRNA, or other proteins, can enable the functional delivery of these macromolecules into mammalian cells both in vitro and in vivo. The potency of functional delivery in some cases can exceed that of other current methods for macromolecule delivery, including the use of cell-penetrating peptides such as Tat and adenoviral delivery vectors. This chapter summarizes methods for engineering supercharged proteins, optimiz- ing cell penetration, identifying naturally occurring supercharged proteins, and using these proteins for macromolecule delivery into mammalian cells.},

@article{Aida_1990,
	Abstract = {Endotoxin contamination of protein solutions was reduced by a phase separation technique using the detergent, Triton X-114. Protein solutions containing endotoxin were treated with Triton X-114 on ice. The solution was then warmed to 37$\,^{\circ}$C, whereupon two phases formed. The Triton X-114 phase, containing the endotoxin, was precipitated by centrifugation. The first cycle of phase separation produced a 1000-fold reduction of endotoxin from contaminated preparations of cytochrome c, catalase and albumin. Complete removal of endotoxin could be achieved by further cycles of phase separation. Each cycle of phase separation resulted in only a 2% loss of protein, and could be completed within 15 rain. The small amount of detergent (0.018%) that persisted in protein solution could be removed by gel filtration or absorption. Proteins treated by this procedure retained normal functions. This phase separation technique provides a rapid and gentle method for removing endotoxin from protein solutions.},

	Abstract = {During the course of gene therapy experiments in rodents, using intramuscular injections of plasmid DNA derived from Escherichia coli, w e noted dose-related toxicity. This observation prompted a search for possible contaminantsofDNAsamples.We usedthehighlyspeciflcandsensitivelimulusamoebocytelysateassay (LAL), to monitor endotoxin bioactivity in D N A samples, and found plasmid D N A derived from standard E . coli bacterial strains, using traditional D N A isolation protocols, to be heavily contaminated with endotoxin, or lipopolysaccharide (LPA). Standard D N A isolation procedures result in the copurification of up to 500 ^.g/ml o f L P S . L P S is a p o t e n t i n d u c e r o f c y t o k i n e s a n d o t h e r i n f l a m m a t o r y m e d i a t o r s , a n d m a y c o m p l i c a t e t h e u s e o f naked D N A in gene therapy. The copurification of endotoxin with plasmid D N A also has important implica- tionsforinvitrotransfectionstudiesandmicroinjectionofDNA intoembryos.A simpleandefficientprotocol to reduce L P S contamination of plasmid D N A was developed. The conversion of intact bacteria to spheroplasts prior to the isolation of plasmid D N A , incubation with lysozyme, treatment with the detergent n-octyl-^-D- thioglucopyranoside ( O S P G ) and polymyxin-B ( P M B ) chromatography, allowed the isolation of plasmid D N A containing less than 50 ng/ml LPS. This represents a 10,000-fold reduction in L P S contamination, compared to conventional methods of plasmid D N A purification, avoids potentially toxic reagents such as ethidium bro- mide,andproducesahigheryieldofplasmid DNA.},

@article{Zimmerman_2006,
	Abstract = {Endotoxins are frequent contaminants of recombinant proteins produced in Escherichia coli. Due to their adverse effects, endotoxins have to be removed from recombinant proteins prior their use in cell-based assays or parenteral application. Reduction of endotoxin to less than 10 EU mg− 1 is, however, one of the most problematic steps during protein purification from E. coli and often associated with substantial loss of biological materials. The present paper describes the use of a single step procedure enabling metal chelate affinity purification and endotoxin clearance from antibody fragments produced in E. coli using a non-ionic detergent. Endotoxin content was as low as 5 to 9 EU mg− 1 with a recovery of antibody fragments of over 90%. Non-ionic detergent treatment did not compromise integrity and functionality of these multimeric molecules. Furthermore, recombinant antibody fragments did not stimulate endotoxin-sensitive cell lines confirming the low endotoxin content. In conclusion, this one- step protocol is a rapid, cost effective and automation-compatible procedure suitable for recombinant antibody fragments.},
