	Abstract = {Collagenases are the principal enzymes responsible forthe degradation of collagens during embryonic development, woundhealing, and cancer metastasis. However, the mechanism by whichthese enzymes disrupt the highly chemically and structurally stablecollagen triple helix remains incompletely understood. We used asingle-molecule magnetic tweezers assay to characterize the cleavage ofheterotrimeric collagen I by both the human collagenase matrixmetalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) and collagenase from Clostridiumhistolyticum. We observe that the application of 16 pN of force causesan 8-fold increase in collagen proteolysis rates by MMP-1 but does notaffect cleavage rates by Clostridium collagenase. Quantitative analysis of these data allows us to infer the structural changes in collagen associated with proteolytic cleavage by both enzymes. Our data support a model in which MMP-1 cuts a transient, stretched conformation of its recognition site. In contrast, our findings suggest that Clostridium collagenase is able to cleave the fully wound collagen triple helix, accounting for its lack of force sensitivity and low sequence specificity. We observe that the cleavage of heterotrimeric collagen is less force sensitive than the proteolysis of a homotrimeric collagen model peptide, consistent with studies suggesting that the MMP-1 recognition site in heterotrimeric collagen I is partially unwound at equilibrium.},

	Abstract = {Although mechanical stress is known to profoundly influence the composition and structure of the extra- cellular matrix (ECM), the mechanisms by which this regula- tion occurs remain poorly understood. We used a single- molecule magnetic tweezers assay to study the effect of force on collagen proteolysis by matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1). Here we show that the application of ∼10 pN in extensional force causes an ∼100-fold increase in proteo- lysis rates. Our results support a mechanistic model in which the collagen triple helix unwinds prior to proteolysis. The data and resulting model predict that biologically relevant forces may increase localized ECM proteolysis, suggesting a possible role for mechanical force in the regulation of ECM remodeling.},

@article{Eeftens_2015,
	Abstract = {Background: Single-molecule techniques have proven to be an excellent approach for quantitatively studying DNA-protein interactions at the single-molecule level. In magnetic tweezers, a force is applied to a biopolymer that is anchored between a glass surface and a magnetic bead. Whereas the relevant force regime for many biological processes is above 20pN, problems arise at these higher forces, since the molecule of interest can detach from the attachment points at the surface or the bead. Whereas many recipes for attachment of biopolymers have been developed, most methods do not suffice, as the molecules break at high force, or the attachment chemistry leads to nonspecific cross reactions with proteins.Results: Here, we demonstrate a novel attachment method using copper-free click chemistry, where a DBCO-tagged DNA molecule is bound to an azide-functionalized surface. We use this new technique to covalently attach DNA to a flow cell surface. We show that this technique results in covalently linked tethers that are torsionally constrained and withstand very high forces (>100pN) in magnetic tweezers.Conclusions: This novel anchoring strategy using copper-free click chemistry allows to specifically and covalently link biomolecules, and conduct high-force single-molecule experiments. Excitingly, this advance opens up the possibility for single-molecule experiments on DNA-protein complexes and molecules that are taken directly from cell lysate.},

	Abstract = {the success of single-molecule (sM) experiments critically depends on the functional immobilization of the biomolecule(s) to be studied. With the continuing trend of combining sM fluorescence with sM force experiments, methods are required that are suitable for both types of measurements. We describe a general protocol for the site-specific and covalent coupling of any type of biomolecule that can be prepared with a free thiol group. the protocol uses a poly(ethylene glycol) (peG) spacer, which carries an N-hydroxy succinimide (nHs) group on one end and a maleimide group on the other. after reacting the nHs group with an amino-functionalized surface, the relatively stable but highly reactive maleimide group allows the coupling of the biomolecule. this protocol provides surfaces with low fluorescence background, low nonspecific binding and a large number of reactive sites. surfaces containing immobilized biomolecules can be obtained within 6 h.},

	Abstract = {Biochemical affinity assays inherently involveinteractions of heterogeneous nature. We report a method-ology to discriminate between and accurately characterizespecific and nonspecific interactions in force-induced dissoci-ation assays. Ligand-coupled superparamagnetic particles areincubated on surfaces coated with a mixture of specificreceptors and nonspecifically interacting proteins. Conse-quently, a mixed population of surface bound particles isformed with different binding natures. Magnetic field gradientsare used to apply translational forces on the bound particles.Using a multicomponent dissociation analysis, we are able tomake a distinction between weak nonspecific interactions, strong nonspecific interactions, and specific interactions. We validate the model by comprehensive experiments in which the biochemical components and applied forces are varied. The low-force data yield reliable values for the spontaneous dissociation rates of single-molecule specific bonds, and at high forces, the bond barriers are modified by the applied force. The results generate a new perspective for applications of magnetic force affinity assays in studies of heterogeneous molecular biorecognition.},

PREP
Polystyrene substrates (2 x 2 cm2) were cut from untreated tissue culture plates (Phoenix Biomedicals). The surfaces were provided with a double sided adhesive (Secure-SealTM imaging spacer, Sigma) to create an open cell of 9 mm diameter and 0.12 mm depth. The polystyrene surface enclosed within the cell was functionalized by physically adsorbing the protein (anti-biotin, streptavidin and BSA- biotin) in a solution of 150 mM phosphate buffer saline, pH 7.4 (Sigma). In order to covalently bind biotin to the polystyrene, the bottom surface of the cell consisting of polystyrene was chemically oxidized with KMnO4 and H2SO4. This creates COOH groups on the surface to which EZ-Link  Amine-PEG3-biotin was covalently bound using EDC and NHS. All functionalized polystyrene surfaces were finally blocked with 10% skimmed milk proteins in 150mM PBS (pH 7.4) for 30 minutes followed by washing in PBS. Milk proteins are known to be effective blockers due to their broad protein composition.

1. Capillary tubes are cleaned in a nitric acid bath for 4 h and then rinsed extensively with water and dried with a stream of clean argon.2. One end of the capillary is dipped into the polystyrene solution so asto draw in about 15µL3. The capillary is slowly tipped at one end and then the other so as tocoat the entire inner surface with the polystyrene solution. This should be done no more than two or three times, as a thick polystyrene layer will be more unstable than a thin one.4. Excess solution is wicked out of the capillary, which then is dried with a stream of clean argon.5. The ends of the capillary are fitted with a 2-cm length of Tygon tubing.

	Abstract = {Recent advances in high-throughput single-molecule magnetic tweezers have paved the way for obtaining information on individual molecules as well as ensemble-averaged behavior in a single assay. Here we describe how to design robust high-throughput magnetic tweezers assays that specifically require application of high forces (>20 pN) for prolonged periods of time (>1000 s). We elaborate on the strengths and limitations of the typical construct types that can be used and provide a step-by- step guide towards a high tether yield assay based on two examples. Firstly, we discuss a DNA hairpin assay where force-induced strand separation triggers a tight interaction between DNA-binding protein Tus and its binding site Ter, where forces up to 90 pN for hundreds of seconds were required to dissociate Tus from Ter. Secondly, we show how the LTag helicase of Simian virus 40 unwinds dsDNA, where a load of 36 pN optimizes the assay readout. The approaches detailed here provide guidelines for the high-throughput, quantitative study of a wide range of DNA-protein interactions.},

Then the bottom glass surfaces were coated with nitrocellulose. For this, nitrocellulose membrane paper (Invitrogen, USA) was dissolved (1% m/V) in ethanol as a stock by mixing the components in a tube shaker at 35  C.

	Abstract = {Recent advances in single-molecule methodology have made it possible to study the dynamic behavior of individual enzymes and their interactions with other proteins in multiprotein complexes. Here, we describe newly developed methods to study the coordination of DNA unwinding, priming, and synthesis at the DNA- replication fork. The length of individual DNA molecules is used to measure the activity of single replisomes engaged in coordinated DNA replication. First, a tethered-particle technique is used to visualize the formation and release of replication loops. Second, a fluorescence imaging method provides a direct readout of replication rates and processivities from individual replisomes. The ability to directly observe transient reaction intermediates and characterize heterogeneous behavior makes these single-molecule approaches important new additions to the tools available to study DNA replication.},
	Annote = {FUNCTIONALIZATION --- PEG/biotin

Attachment of the DNA tethers occurs via a biotin--streptavidin--biotin linkage. Glass microscope coverslips are covalently functionalized with biotin-bearing poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG), providing an inert layer between proteins, DNA tethers and the glass to reduce nonspecific inter- actions (Sofia et al., 1998).

Pipette 100µl of PEG solution on the center of a glass coverslip. Place nonfunctionalized spacer coverslips on the edges of the target slip and create a ``sandwich'' by placing another silanized slip on top of the liquid bubble. This allows good spreading of the PEG solution across the entire surface of the coverslips and eliminates any drying by evaporation. The spacers allow the two coverslips to be separated easily.
