	Abstract = {Protein conformation is critically linked to function and often controlled by interactions with regulatory factors. Here we report the selection of camelid-derived single-domain antibodies (nanobodies) that modulate the conformation and spectral properties of the green fluorescent protein (GFP). One nanobody could reversibly reduce GFP fluorescence by a factor of 5, whereas its displacement by a second nanobody caused an increase by a factor of 10. Structural analysis of GFP--nanobody complexes revealed that the two nanobodies induce subtle opposing changes in the chromophore environment, leading to altered absorption properties. Unlike conventional antibodies, the small, stable nanobodies are functional in living cells. Nanobody-induced changes were detected by ratio imaging and used to monitor protein expression and subcellular localization as well as translocation events such as the tamoxifen-induced nuclear localization of estrogen receptor. This work demonstrates that protein conformations can be manipulated and studied with nanobodies in living cells.},

	Abstract = {By virtue of their size, functional group diversity, and complex structure, proteins can often recognize and modulate disease-relevant macromolecules that present a challenge to small- molecule reagents. Additionally, high-throughput screening and evolution-based methods often make the discovery of new protein binders simpler than the analogous small-molecule discovery process. However, most proteins do not cross the lipid bilayer membrane of mammalian cells. This largely limits the scope of protein therapeutics and basic research tools to those targeting disease-relevant receptors on the cell surface or extracellular matrix. Previously, researchers have shown that cationic resurfacing of proteins can endow cell penetration. However, in our experi- ence, many proteins are not amenable to such extensive mutagenesis. Here, we report that nano- bodies---a small and stable protein that can be evolved to recognize virtually any disease-relevant receptor---are amenable to cationic resurfacing, which results in cell internalization. Once internal- ized, these nanobodies access the cytosol. Polycationic resurfacing does not appreciably alter the structure, expression, and function (target recognition) of a previously reported GFP-binding nano- body, and multiple nanobody scaffolds are amenable to polycationic resurfacing. Given this, we propose that polycationic resurfaced cell-penetrating nanobodies might represent a general scaf- fold for intracellularly targeted protein drug discovery.},

	Abstract = {Abstract : Fluorescent proteins are transformative tools ; thus, any brightness increase is a welcome improvement. We invented the ``vGFP strategy'' based on structural analysis of GFP bound to a single-domain antibody, predicting tunable dimerization, enhanced brightness (ca. 50%), and improved pH resistance. We verified all of these predictions using biochemistry, crystallography, and single-molecule studies. We applied the vsfGFP proteins in three diverse scenarios: single-step immunofluorescence in vitro (3 {\^\i} brighter due to dimerization); expression in bacteria and human cells in vivo (1.5 {\^\i} brighter) ; and protein fusions showing better pH resistance in human cells in vivo. The vGFP strategy thus allows upgrading of existing applications, is applicable to other fluorescent proteins, and suggests a method for tuning dimerization of arbitrary proteins and optimizing protein properties in general.},

	Abstract = {Quantitative proteome research is greatly promoted by high-resolution parallel format assays. A characterization of protein complexes based on binding forces offers an unparalleled dynamic range and allows for the effective discrimination of non-specific interactions. Here we present a DNA-based Molecular Force Assay to quantify protein-protein interactions, namely the bond between different variants of GFP and GFP-binding nanobodies. We present different strategies to adjust the maximum sensitivity window of the assay by influencing the binding strength of the DNA reference duplexes. The binding of the nanobody Enhancer to the different GFP constructs is compared at high sensitivity of the assay. Whereas the binding strength to wild type and enhanced GFP are equal within experimental error, stronger binding to superfolder GFP is observed. This difference in binding strength is attributed to alterations in the amino acids that form contacts according to the crystal structure of the initial wild type GFP-Enhancer complex. Moreover, we outline the potential for large-scale parallelization of the assay.},

	Abstract = {
Nanobodies (Nbs)---the smallest known fully functional and naturally occuring antigen-binding fragments---have attracted a lot of attention throughout the last two decades. Exploring their potential beyond the current use requires more detailed characterization of their binding forces as those cannot be directly derived from the binding affinities. Here we used atomic force microscope to measure rupture force of the Nb--green fluorescent protein (GFP) complex in various pulling geometries and derived the energy profile characterizing the interaction along the direction of the pulling force. We found that---despite identical epitopes---the Nb binds stronger (41--56 pN) to enhanced GFP than to wild-type GFP (28--45 pN). Measured forces make the Nb--GFP pair a potent reference for investigating molecular forces in living systems both in and ex vivo.},

	Abstract = {The green fluorescent protein (GFP)-nanobody is a single-chain VHH antibody domain developed with specific binding activity against GFP and is emerging as a powerful tool for isolation and cellular engineering of fluorescent protein fusions in many different fields of biological research. Using X-ray crystallography and isothermal titration calorimetry, we determine the molecular details of GFP:GFP-nanobody complex formation and explain the basis of high affinity and at the same time high specificity of protein binding. Although the GFP-nanobody can also bind YFP, it cannot bind the closely related CFP or other fluorescent proteins from the mFruit series. CFP differs from GFP only within the central chromophore and at one surface amino acid position, which lies in the binding interface. Using this information, we have engineered a CFP variant (I146N) that is also able to bind the GFP-nanobody with high affinity, thus extending the toolbox of genetically encoded fluorescent probes that can be isolated using the GFP-nanobody.

	Abstract = {Green fluorescent proteins (GFPs) and variants thereof are widely used to study protein localization and dynam- ics. We engineered a specific binder for fluorescent pro- teins based on a 13-kDa GFP binding fragment derived from a llama single chain antibody. This GFP-binding pro- tein (GBP) can easily be produced in bacteria and coupled to a monovalent matrix. The GBP allows a fast and effi- cient (one-step) isolation of GFP fusion proteins and their interacting factors for biochemical analyses including mass spectroscopy and enzyme activity measurements. Moreover GBP is also suitable for chromatin immunopre- cipitations from cells expressing fluorescent DNA-binding proteins. Most importantly, GBP can be fused with cellular proteins to ectopically recruit GFP fusion proteins allow- ing targeted manipulation of cellular structures and pro- cesses in living cells. Because of the high affinity capture of GFP fusion proteins in vitro and in vivo and a size in the lower nanometer range we refer to the immobilized GFP-binding protein as GFP-nanotrap. This versatile GFP-nanotrap enables a unique combination of micro- scopic, biochemical, and functional analyses with one and the same protein.},

	Abstract = {Nanobodies are single-domain antibodies derived from the variable regions of Camelidae atypical immunoglobulins. They show promise as high-affinity reagents for research, diagnostics and therapeutics owing to their high specificity, small size (~15 kDa) and straightforward bacterial expression. However, identification of repertoires with sufficiently high affinity has proven time consuming and difficult, hampering nanobody implementation. Our approach generates large repertoires of readily expressible recombinant nanobodies with high affinities and specificities against a given antigen. We demonstrate the efficacy of this approach through the production of large repertoires of nanobodies against two antigens, GFP and mCherry, with Kd values into the subnanomolar range. After mapping diverse epitopes on GFP, we were also able to design ultrahigh-affinity dimeric nanobodies with Kd values as low as ~30 pM. The approach presented here is well suited for the routine production of high-affinity capture reagents for various biomedical applications.},

Here we present a strategy for isolating complexes at endogenous levels from GFP-tagged transgenic cell lines.
