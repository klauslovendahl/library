	Abstract = {The overall stability of globular protein structures is marginal, a balance between large numbers of stabilizing non-covalent interactions and a destabilizing entropic term. Higher stability can be engineered by introduction of disulfide bonds, provided the redox environment is controlled. The discovery of stabilizing isopeptide bond crosslinks, formed spontaneously between lysine and asparagine (or aspartic acid) side chains in certain bacterial cell-surface proteins suggests that such bonds could be introduced by protein engineering as an alternative protein stabilization strategy. We report the first example of an isopeptide bond engineered de novo into an immunoglobulin-like protein, the minor pilin FctB from Streptococcus pyogenes. Four mutations were sufficient; lysine, asparagine and glutamic acid residues were introduced for the bond-forming reaction, with a fourth Val/Phe mutation to help steer the lysine side chain into position. The spontaneously-formed isopeptide bond was confirmed by mass spectrometry and X-ray crystallography, and was shown to increase the thermal stability by 10 $\,^{\circ}$C compared with the wild type protein. This novel method for increasing the stability of IgG-like proteins has potential to be adopted by the field of antibody engineering, which share similar β-clasp Ig-type domains.},

Based on the crystal structure of RrgA, the Streptococcus pneumoniae pilus adhesin, we provide evidence that two engineered protein fragments retain their ability to associate covalently with high specificity, in vivo and in vitro, once isolated from the parent protein. We determined the optimal conditions for the assembly of the complex and we solved its crystal structure at 2 {\AA}. Furthermore, we demonstrate biotechnological applications related to antibody production, nanoassembly and cell-surface labeling based on this process we named Bio Molecular Welding.},

@article{Proschel_2017,
	Abstract = {Building proteins into larger, post-translational assemblies in a defined and stable way is still a challenging task. A promising approach relies on so-called tag/catcher systems that are fused to the proteins of interest and allow a durable linkage via covalent intermolecular bonds. Tags and catchers are generated by splitting protein domains that contain intramolecular isopeptide or ester bonds that form autocatalytically under physiological conditions. There are already numerous biotechnological and medical applications that demonstrate the usefulness of covalent linkages mediated by these systems. Additional covalent tag/catcher systems would allow creating more complex and ultra-stable protein architectures and networks. Two of the presently available tag/catcher systems were derived from closely related CnaB-domains of Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus dysgalactiae proteins. However, it is unclear whether domain splitting is generally tolerated within the CnaB-family or only by a small subset of these domains. To address this point, we have selected a set of four CnaB domains of low sequence similarity and characterized the resulting tag/catcher systems by computational and experimental methods. Experimental testing for intermolecular isopeptide bond formation demonstrated two of the four systems to be functional. For these two systems length and sequence variations of the peptide tags were investigated revealing only a relatively small effect on the efficiency of the reaction. Our study suggests that splitting into tag and catcher moieties is tolerated by a significant portion of the naturally occurring CnaB-domains, thus providing a large reservoir for the design of novel tag/catcher systems.},

	Abstract = {Spontaneous isopeptide bond formation, a stabilizing posttranslational modi cation that can be found in gram-positive bacterial cell surface proteins, has previously been used to develop a peptide-peptide ligation technology that enables the polymerization of tagged-proteins catalyzed by SpyLigase. Here we adapted this technology to establish a novel modular antibody labeling approach which is based on isopeptide bond formation between two recognition peptides, SpyTag and KTag. Our labeling strategy allows the attachment of a reporting cargo of interest to an antibody sca old by fusing it chemically to KTag, available via semi-automated solid-phase peptide synthesis (SPPS), while equipping the antibody with SpyTag. This strategy was successfully used to engineer site-speci c antibody-drug conjugates (ADCs) that exhibit cytotoxicities in the subnanomolar range. Our approach may lead to a new class of antibody conjugates based on peptide-tags that have minimal e ects on protein structure and function, thus expanding the toolbox of site-speci c antibody conjugation.},

@article{Schoene_2014,
	Abstract = {SpyTag is a peptide that spontaneously forms an amide bond with its protein partner SpyCatcher. SpyTag was fused at the N terminus of b-lactamase and SpyCatcher at the C terminus so that the partners could react to lock together the termini of the enzyme. The wild-type enzyme aggregates above 378C, with irreversible loss of activity. Cyclized b-lactamase was soluble even after heating at 100 8C ; after cooling, the catalytic activity was restored. SpyTag/SpyCatcher cyclization led to a much larger increase in stability than that achieved through point mutation or alternative approaches to cycliza- tion. Cyclized dihydrofolate reductase was similarly resilient. Analyzing unfolding through calorimetry indicated that cycli- zation did not increase the unfolding temperature but rather facilitated refolding after thermal stress. SpyTag/SpyCatcher sandwiching represents a simple and efficient route to enzyme cyclization, with potential to greatly enhance the robustness of biocatalysts.

	Abstract = {Virus-like particles (VLPs) are non-infectious self-assembling nanoparticles, useful in medicine and nanotechnology. Their repetitive molecularly-de ned architecture is attractive for engineering multivalency, notably for vaccination. However, decorating VLPs with target-antigens by genetic fusion or chemical modi cation is time-consuming and often leads to capsid misassembly or antigen misfolding, hindering generation of protective immunity. Here we establish a platform for irreversibly decorating VLPs simply by mixing with protein antigen. SpyCatcher is a genetically-encoded protein designed to spontaneously form a covalent bond to its peptide-partner SpyTag. We expressed in E. coli VLPs from the bacteriophage AP205 genetically fused to SpyCatcher. We demonstrated quantitative covalent coupling to SpyCatcher-VLPs after mixing with SpyTag-linked to malaria antigens, including CIDR and Pfs25. In addition, we showed coupling to the VLPs for peptides relevant to cancer from epidermal growth factor receptor and telomerase. Injecting SpyCatcher-VLPs decorated with a malarial antigen e ciently induced antibody responses after only a single immunization. This simple, e cient and modular decoration of nanoparticles should accelerate vaccine development, as well as other applications of nanoparticle devices.},

	Abstract = {Programmed connection of amino acids or nucleotides into chains introduced a revolution in control of biological function. Reacting proteins together is more complex because of the number of reactive groups and delicate stability. Here we achieved sequence- programmed irreversible connection of protein units, forming polyprotein teams by sequential amidation and transamidation. SpyTag peptide is engineered to spontaneously form an isopep- tide bond with SpyCatcher protein. By engineering the adhesin RrgA from Streptococcus pneumoniae, we developed the peptide SnoopTag, which formed a spontaneous isopeptide bond to its protein partner SnoopCatcher with >99% yield and no cross- reaction to SpyTag/SpyCatcher. Solid-phase attachment followed by sequential SpyTag or SnoopTag reaction between building-blocks enabled iterative extension. Linear, branched, and combinatorial polyproteins were synthesized, identifying optimal combinations of ligands against death receptors and growth factor receptors for cancer cell death signal activation. This simple and modular route to programmable ``polyproteams'' should enable exploration of a new area of biological space.},

	Abstract = {Individual proteins can now often be modified with atomic precision, but there are still major obstacles to connecting proteins into larger assemblies. To direct protein assembly, ideally, peptide tags would be used, providing the minimal perturbation to protein function. However, binding to peptides is generally weak, so assemblies are unstable over time and disassemble with force or harsh conditions. We have recently developed an irreversible protein--peptide interaction (SpyTag/SpyCatcher), based on a pro- tein domain from Streptococcus pyogenes, that locks itself to- gether via spontaneous isopeptide bond formation. Here we develop irreversible peptide--peptide interaction, through rede- sign of this domain and genetic dissection into three parts: a pro- tein domain termed SpyLigase, which now ligates two peptide tags to each other. All components expressed efficiently in Escher- ichia coli and peptide tags were reactive at the N terminus, at the C terminus, or at internal sites. Peptide--peptide ligation enabled covalent and site-specific polymerization of affibodies or antibod- ies against the tumor markers epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) and HER2. Magnetic capture of circulating tumor cells (CTCs) is one of the most promising approaches to improve cancer prognosis and management, but CTC capture is limited by ineffi- cient recovery of cells expressing low levels of tumor antigen. SpyLigase-assembled protein polymers made possible the isola- tion of cancerous cells expressing lower levels of tumor antigen and should have general application in enhancing molecular capture.},

	Abstract = {Protein interactions with peptides generally have low thermo- dynamic and mechanical stability. Streptococcus pyogenes fibro- nectin-binding protein FbaB contains a domain with a spontaneous isopeptide bond between Lys and Asp. By splitting this domain and rational engineering of the fragments, we obtained a peptide (SpyTag) which formed an amide bond to its protein partner (Spy- Catcher) in minutes. Reaction occurred in high yield simply upon mixing and amidst diverse conditions of pH, temperature, and buffer. SpyTag could be fused at either terminus or internally and reacted specifically at the mammalian cell surface. Peptide binding was not reversed by boiling or competing peptide. Single-molecule dynamic force spectroscopy showed that SpyTag did not separate from SpyCatcher until the force exceeded 1 nN, where covalent bonds snap. The robust reaction conditions and irreversible linkage of SpyTag shed light on spontaneous isopeptide bond formation and should provide a targetable lock in cells and a stable module for new protein architectures.},

Visualization of membrane protein localization and trafficking in live cells facilitates understanding the molecular basis of cellular dynamics. We describe here a method for specifically labeling the plasma membrane-localized fraction of heterologous membrane protein expres- sion using channelrhodopsins as a case study. We show that the genetically encoded, covalent binding SpyTag and SpyCatcher pair from the Streptococcus pyogenes fibronectin-binding protein FbaB can selectively label membrane-localized proteins in living cells in culture and in vivo in Caenorhabditis elegans. The SpyTag/SpyCatcher covalent labeling method is highly specific, modular, and stable in living cells. We have used the binding pair to develop a channelrhodopsin membrane localization assay that is amenable to high-throughput screening for opsin discovery and engineering.},

@article{Thrane_2016,
	Abstract = {Background: Virus‐like particles (VLPs) represent a signi cant advance in the development of subunit vaccines, com‐ bining high safety and e cacy. Their particulate nature and dense repetitive subunit organization makes them ideal sca olds for display of vaccine antigens. Traditional approaches for VLP‐based antigen display require labor‐intensive trial‐and‐error optimization, and often fail to generate dense antigen display. Here we utilize the split‐intein (SpyTag/ SpyCatcher) conjugation system to generate stable isopeptide bound antigen‐VLP complexes by simply mixing of the antigen and VLP components.
Results: Genetic fusion of SpyTag or SpyCatcher to the N‐terminus and/or C‐terminus of the Acinetobacter phage AP205 capsid protein resulted in formation of stable, nonaggregated VLPs expressing one SpyCatcher, one SpyTag
or two SpyTags per capsid protein. Mixing of spy‐VLPs with eleven di erent vaccine antigens fused to SpyCatcher or SpyTag resulted in formation of antigen‐VLP complexes with coupling e ciencies (% occupancy of total VLP binding sites) ranging from 22--88 %. In mice, spy‐VLP vaccines presenting the malaria proteins Pfs25 or VAR2CSA markedly increased antibody titer, a nity, longevity and functional e cacy compared to corresponding vaccines employing monomeric proteins. The spy‐VLP vaccines also e ectively broke B cell self‐tolerance and induced potent and durable antibody responses upon vaccination with cancer or allergy‐associated self‐antigens (PD‐L1, CTLA‐4 and IL‐5).
Conclusions: The spy‐VLP system constitutes a versatile and rapid method to develop highly immunogenic VLP‐ based vaccines. Our data provide proof‐of‐concept for the technology's ability to present complex vaccine antigens to the immune system and elicit robust functional antibody responses as well as to e ciently break B cell self‐toler‐ ance. The spy‐VLP‐system may serve as a generic tool for the cost‐e ective development of e ective VLP‐vaccines against both infectious‐ and non‐communicable diseases and could facilitate rapid and unbiased screening of vac‐ cine candidate antigens.},

	Abstract = {Successful isolation of well-folded and active protein often first requires the creation of many constructs. These are needed to assess the effects of truncations, insertions, mutations, and the presence and position of different affinity tags. Determining which constructs yield the highest expression and solubility requires the investigator to express and partially purify each construct, and, in the case of low- expressing proteins, to follow the protein using time-consuming Western blots. Even then, many proteins form soluble aggregates, which may only be apparent after more extensive purification via size exclusion chromatography. In this work, we have utilized a covalent bond-forming tag/domain pair, known as SpyTag/SpyCatcher, to rapidly and specifically attach a fluorescent label to proteins of interest in cellular lysates. Once labeled, tagged proteins can easily be followed via SDS--PAGE and fluorescence size exclu- sion chromatography (F-SEC) to assess expression levels, solubility, and monodispersity without the need for purification. These techniques enable rapid and facile analysis of proteins, which may greatly facilitate optimization of protein expression constructs.},

	Abstract = {Peptide tagging is a key strategy for observing and isolating proteins. However, the interactions of proteins with peptides are nearly all rapidly reversible. Proteins tagged with the peptide SpyTag form an irreversible covalent bond to the SpyCatcher protein via a spontaneous isopeptide linkage, thereby offering a genetically encoded way to create peptide interactions that resist force and harsh conditions. Here, we determined the crystal structure of the reconstituted covalent complex of SpyTag and SpyCatcher at 2.1 {\AA} resolution. The structure showed the expected reformation of the β-sandwich domain seen in the parental streptococcal adhesin, but flanking sequences at both N- and C-termini of SpyCatcher were disordered. In addition, only 10 out of 13 amino acids of the SpyTag peptide were observed to interact with SpyCatcher, pointing to specific contacts important for rapid split protein reconstitution. Based on these structural insights, we expressed a range of SpyCatcher variants and identified a minimized SpyCatcher, 32 residues shorter, that maintained rapid reaction with SpyTag. Together, these results give insight into split protein β-strand complementation and enhance a distinct approach to ultrastable molecular interaction.},
