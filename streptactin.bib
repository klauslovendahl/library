	Abstract = {The ``Strep tag'' is a nine amino acid peptide with intrinsic streptavidin-binding activity. If this sequence is genetically fused to the C-terminus of a polypeptide the recombinant protein can be directly purified by affinity chromatography from the host cell extract on immobilized streptavidin. However, variations were observed in the suitability of different commercial streptavidin-agarose preparations for this purpose. Therefore, the influence of the source of streptavidin, the coupling chemistry, and the nature of the affinity chromatography resin was investigated. A procedure was developed for the production of recombinant core streptavidin in Escherichia coli, followed by its efficient refolding and purification with an overall yield of up to 140 mg functional protein per 1 1 bacterial culture. When coupled to activated CH-Sepharose 4B this truncated form of streptavidin showed a performance in the affinity chromatography of Strep tag fusion proteins that was superior to all other combinations tested. In contrast to its conventional preparation from Streptomyces strains the recombinant core streptavidin was produced without a proteolytic processing step. Thus, deleterious effects during the streptavidin affinity purification of proteins due to residual proteolytic activity in the immobilized streptavidin were avoided. The versatility of the optimized purification system was demonstrated with five different Strep tag fusion proteins.},

@article{Gallizia_1998,
	Abstract = {The cDNA for streptavidin (residues 15--159) was subcloned into an expression vector in fusion at the N-terminus with the T7-tag (12 residues). Conditions were found to express the protein inEscherichia coliin a soluble, assembled, and active form. The protein was purified in two simple steps which involved heating at 75$\,^{\circ}$C and affinity chromatography on iminobiotin agarose. The purified protein was obtained in yields of 70 mg per liter of bacterial culture. Electron spray mass spectrometry analysis showed that the recombinant streptavidin had the expected molecular mass without covalent modifications. ELISA and surface plasmon resonance analyses showed it to be functionally analogous to the natural streptavidin. This appears to be an improvement over the reported methods of recombinant streptavidin production which involve protein renaturation or the use of eukaryotic expression systems.

@article{Korndorfer_2002,
	Abstract = {The Strep-tag II is a nine-amino acid peptide that was developed as an affinity tool for the purification of corresponding fusion proteins on streptavidin columns. The peptide recognizes the same pocket of streptavidin where the natural ligand is normally bound so that biotin or its chemical derivatives can be used for competitive elution. We report here the crystal structures of the streptavidin mutants '1' and '2,' which had been engineered for 10-fold higher affinity towards the Strep-tag II. Both streptavidin mutants carry mutations at positions 44, 45, and 47, that is, in a flexible loop region close to the binding site. The crystal structures of the two apo-proteins and their complexes with the Strep-tag II peptide were refined at resolutions below 2 A. Both in the presence and absence of the peptide, the lid-like loop next to the ligand pocket--comprising residues 45 through 52--adopts an 'open' conformation in all four subunits within the asymmetric unit. The same loop was previously described to be disordered in the wild-type apo-streptavidin and to close over the pocket upon complexation of the natural ligand biotin. Our findings suggest that stabilization of the 'open' loop conformation in the absence of a ligand abolishes the need for conformational rearrangement prior to the docking of the voluminous peptide. Because no direct contacts between the flexible part of the loop and the peptide ligand were detected, it seems likely that the higher affinity of the two streptavidin mutants for the Strep-tag II is caused by a predominantly entropic mechanism.},

	Abstract = {This protocol describes a simple and efficient way to label specific cell surface proteins with biophysical probes on mammalian cells. Cell surface proteins tagged with a 15-amino acid peptide are biotinylated by Escherichia coli biotin ligase (BirA), whereas endogenous proteins are not modified. The biotin group then allows sensitive and stable binding by streptavidin conjugates. This protocol describes the optimal use of BirA and streptavidin for site-specific labeling and also how to produce BirA and monovalent streptavidin. Streptavidin is tetravalent and the cross-linking of biotinylated targets disrupts many of streptavidin's applications. Monovalent streptavidin has only a single functional biotin-binding site, but retains the femtomolar affinity, low off-rate and high thermostability of wild-type streptavidin. Site-specific biotinylation and streptavidin staining take only a few minutes, while expression of BirA takes 4 d and expression of monovalent streptavidin takes 8 d.},

	Abstract = {Strep-Tactin, an engineered form of streptavidin, binds avidly to the genetically encoded peptide Strep-tag II in a manner comparable to streptavidin binding to biotin. These interactions have been used in protein purification and detection applications. However, in single-molecule studies, for example using atomic force microscopy-based single-molecule force spectroscopy (AFM-SMFS), the tetravalency of these systems impedes the measurement of monodispersed data. Here, we introduce a monovalent form of Strep-Tactin that harbours a unique binding site for Strep-tag II and a single cysteine that allows Strep-Tactin to specifically attach to the atomic force microscope cantilever and form a consistent pulling geometry to obtain homogeneous rupture data. Using AFM-SMFS, the mechanical properties of the interaction between Strep-tag II and monovalent Strep-Tactin were characterized. Rupture forces comparable to biotin:streptavidin unbinding were observed. Using titin kinase and green fluorescent protein, we show that monovalent Strep-Tactin is generally applicable to protein unfolding experiments. We expect monovalent Strep-Tactin to be a reliable anchoring tool for a range of single-molecule studies.},

	Abstract = {The Strep-tag II is an eight-residue minimal peptide sequence (Trp-Ser-His-Pro-Gln-Phe-Glu-Lys) that exhibits intrinsic affinity toward streptavidin and can be fused to recombinant proteins in various fashions. We describe a protocol that enables quick and mild purification of corresponding Strep-tag II fusion proteins--including their complexes with interacting partners--both from bacterial and eukaryotic cell lysates using affinity chromatography on a matrix carrying an engineered streptavidin (Strep-Tactin), which can be accomplished within 1 h. A high-affinity monoclonal antibody (StrepMAB-Immo) permits stable immobilization of Strep-tag II fusion proteins to solid surfaces, for example, for surface plasmon resonance analysis. Selective and sensitive detection on western blots is achieved with Strep-Tactin/enzyme conjugates or another monoclonal antibody (StrepMAB-Classic). Thus, the Strep-tag II, which is short, biologically inert, proteolytically stable and does not interfere with membrane translocation or protein folding, offers a versatile tool both for the rapid isolation of a functional gene product and for its detection or molecular interaction analysis.},

@article{Voss_1997,
	Abstract = {The Strep-tag, an artificial peptide ligand of streptavidin, has gained use as an affinity handle for the purification and detection of recombinant fusion proteins. In an attempt to achieve tighter complexation of the peptide, streptavidin was engineered and the amino acid residues 44-47 in the flexible loop from 44 to 53, which is close to the binding site, were subjected to random mutagenesis. A fusion between alkaline phosphatase and the Strep-tag II sequence, an improved version of the Strep-tag, was constructed as a molecular probe for peptide binding. By means of a filter-sandwich assay, two streptavidin mutants with significantly stronger binding activity for the Strep-tag II were thus identified from a library of Escherichia coli colonies. Both in an ELISA with the alkaline phosphatase fusion and in a fluorescence titration experiment with the synthetic Strep-tag II peptide, which carried an anthraniloyl group as chromophore, their affinities were found to be higher by more than one order of magnitude compared with wild-type streptavidin. The nature of the amino acid exchanges and an enhanced electrophoretic mobility of the streptavidin tetramers suggest an altered loop conformation to be part of the optimized binding mechanism. When one of the streptavidin mutants was immobilized on a chromatographic column it exhibited clearly improved performance in the purification of Strep-tag II fusion proteins, and desthiobiotin turned out to be a suitable reagent for mild competitive elution.
