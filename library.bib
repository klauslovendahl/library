abstract = {The success of single-molecule (SM) experiments critically depends on the functional immobilization of the biomolecule(s) to be studied. With the continuing trend of combining SM fluorescence with SM force experiments, methods are required that are suitable for both types of measurements. We describe a general protocol for the site-specific and covalent coupling of any type of biomolecule that can be prepared with a free thiol group. The protocol uses a poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) spacer, which carries an N-hydroxy succinimide (NHS) group on one end and a maleimide group on the other. After reacting the NHS group with an amino-functionalized surface, the relatively stable but highly reactive maleimide group allows the coupling of the biomolecule. This protocol provides surfaces with low fluorescence background, low nonspecific binding and a large number of reactive sites. Surfaces containing immobilized biomolecules can be obtained within 6 h.},

abstract = {We present TrackMate, an open source Fiji plugin for the automated, semi-automated, and manual tracking of single-particles. It offers a versatile and modular solution that works out of the box for end users, through a simple and intuitive user interface. It is also easily scriptable and adaptable, operating equally well on 1D over time, 2D over time, 3D over time, or other single and multi-channel image variants. TrackMate provides several visualization and analysis tools that aid in assessing the relevance of results. The utility of TrackMate is further enhanced through its ability to be readily customized to meet specific tracking problems. TrackMate is an extensible platform where developers can easily write their own detection, particle linking, visualization or analysis algorithms within the TrackMate environment. This evolving framework provides researchers with the opportunity to quickly develop and optimize new algorithms based on existing TrackMate modules without the need of having to write . de novo user interfaces, including visualization, analysis and exporting tools.The current capabilities of TrackMate are presented in the context of three different biological problems. First, we perform . Caenorhabditis-elegans lineage analysis to assess how light-induced damage during imaging impairs its early development. Our TrackMate-based lineage analysis indicates the lack of a cell-specific light-sensitive mechanism. Second, we investigate the recruitment of NEMO (NF-$\kappa$B essential modulator) clusters in fibroblasts after stimulation by the cytokine IL-1 and show that photodamage can generate artifacts in the shape of TrackMate characterized movements that confuse motility analysis. Finally, we validate the use of TrackMate for quantitative lifetime analysis of clathrin-mediated endocytosis in plant cells.},

@article{Shemesh2015,
abstract = {Transduction of mechanical forces and chemical signals affect every cell in the human body. Fluid flow in systems such as the lymphatic or circulatory systems modulates not only cell morphology, but also gene expression patterns, extracellular matrix protein secretion and cell-cell and cell-matrix adhesions. Similar to the role of mechanical forces in adaptation of tissues, shear fluid flow orchestrates collective behaviours of adherent cells found at the interface between tissues and their fluidic environments. These behaviours range from alignment of endothelial cells in the direction of flow to stem cell lineage commitment. Therefore, it is important to characterize quantitatively fluid interface-dependent cell activity. Common macro-scale techniques, such as the parallel plate flow chamber and vertical-step flow methods that apply fluid-induced stress on adherent cells, offer standardization, repeatability and ease of operation. However, in order to achieve improved control over a cell's microenvironment, additional microscale-based techniques are needed. The use of microfluidics for this has been recognized, but its true potential has emerged only recently with the advent of hybrid systems, offering increased throughput, multicellular interactions, substrate functionalization on 3D geometries, and simultaneous control over chemical and mechanical stimulation. In this review, we discuss recent advances in microfluidic flow systems for adherent cells and elaborate on their suitability to mimic physiologic micromechanical environments subjected to fluid flow. We describe device design considerations in light of ongoing discoveries in mechanobiology and point to future trends of this promising technology.},

abstract = {Current theories of muscle contraction propose that the power stroke of a myosin motor is the sole source of mechanical energy driving the sliding filaments of a contracting muscle. These models exclude titin, the largest protein in the human body, which determines the passive elasticity of muscles. Here, we show that stepwise unfolding/folding of titin immunoglobulin (Ig) domains occurs in the elastic I band region of intact myofibrils at physiological sarcomere lengths and forces of 6-pN. We use single-molecule techniques to demonstrate that unfolded titin Ig domains undergo a spontaneous stepwise folding contraction at forces below 10 pN, delivering up to 105 zJ of additional contractile energy, which is larger than the mechanical energy delivered by the power stroke of a myosin motor. Thus, it appears inescapable that folding of titin Ig domains is an important, but as yet unrecognized, contributor to the force generated by a contracting muscle.},

@article{Peterson2016,
abstract = {Accurate knowledge of the kinetics of complementary oligonucleotide hybridization is integral to the design and understanding of DNA-based biosensors. In this work, single-molecule fluorescence imaging is applied to measuring rates of hybridization between fluorescently labeled target ssDNA and unlabeled probe ssDNA immobilized on glass surfaces. In the absence of probe site labeling, the capture surface must be highly selective to avoid the influence of nonspecific adsorption on the interpretation of single-molecule imaging results. This is accomplished by increasing the probe molecule site densities by a factor of ∼100 compared to optically resolvable sites so that nonspecific interactions compete with a much greater number of capture sites and by immobilizing sulfonate groups to passivate the surface between probe strands. The resulting substrates exhibit very low nonspecific adsorption, and the selectivity for binding a complementary target sequence exceeds that of a scrambled sequence by nearly 3 orders of magnitude. The population of immobilized DNA probe sites is quantified by counting individual DNA duplexes at low target concentrations, and those results are used to calibrate fluorescence intensities on the same sample at much higher target concentrations to measure a full binding isotherm. Dissociation rates are determined from interfacial residence times of individual DNA duplexes. Equilibrium and rate constants of hybridization, Ka = 38 (±1) $\mu$M(-1), kon = 1.64 (±0.06) × 10(6) M(-1) s(-1), and koff = 4.3 (±0.1) × 10(-2) s(-1), were found not to change with surface density of immobilized probe DNA, indicating that hybridization events at neighboring probe sites are independent. To test the influence of probe-strand immobilization on hybridization, the kinetics of the probe target reaction at the surface were compared with the same reaction in free solution, and the equilibrium constants and dissociation and association rates were found to be nearly equivalent. The selectivity of these capture surfaces should facilitate sensitive investigations of DNA hybridization at the limit of counting molecules. Because the immobilized probe DNA on these surfaces is unlabeled, photobleaching of a probe label is not an issue, allowing capture substrates to be used for long periods of time or even reused in multiple experiments.},

abstract = {Cantilevers and optical tweezers are widely used for micromanipulating cells or biomolecules for measuring their mechanical properties. However, they do not allow easy rotary motion and can sometimes damage the handled material. We present here a system of magnetic tweezers that overcomes those drawbacks while retaining most of the previous dynamometers properties. Electromagnets are coupled to a microscope-based particle tracking system through a digital feedback loop. Magnetic beads are first trapped in a potential well of stiffness approximately 10(-7) N/m. Thus, they can be manipulated in three dimensions at a speed of approximately 10 microm/s and rotated along the optical axis at a frequency of 10 Hz. In addition, our apparatus can work as a dynamometer relying on either usual calibration against the viscous drag or complete calibration using Brownian fluctuations. By stretching a DNA molecule between a magnetic particle and a glass surface, we applied and measured vertical forces ranging from 50 fN to 20 pN. Similarly, nearly horizontal forces up to 5 pN were obtained. From those experiments, we conclude that magnetic tweezers represent a low-cost and biocompatible setup that could become a suitable alternative to the other available micromanipulators.},

Here we show that the application of ∼10 pN in extensional force causes an ∼100-fold increase in proteolysis rates.

Single-stranded DNA molecules of 52-206 nucleotides in length were generated by asymmetric polymerase chain reactions (aPCR), using an excess of one short sense-strand primer to be extended and a limiting amount of each short antisense primer that is complementary to and defines the 3' end of the long primer to be generated. The noncross-linking strand of the DNA probe was also generated by aPCR from the DNA sequence of interest. The long primers were annealed to the full-length noncross-linking DNA strand to form a partially double-stranded DNA. Cross-linking analogs and radioactive deoxyribonucleotides (dNTPs), followed by normal dNTPs, were enzymatically incorporated onto the long primers to form the double-stranded DNA cross-linking probes.

abstract = {BACKGROUND:Single-molecule techniques have proven to be an excellent approach for quantitatively studying DNA-protein interactions at the single-molecule level. In magnetic tweezers, a force is applied to a biopolymer that is anchored between a glass surface and a magnetic bead. Whereas the relevant force regime for many biological processes is above 20pN, problems arise at these higher forces, since the molecule of interest can detach from the attachment points at the surface or the bead. Whereas many recipes for attachment of biopolymers have been developed, most methods do not suffice, as the molecules break at high force, or the attachment chemistry leads to nonspecific cross reactions with proteins.RESULTS:Here, we demonstrate a novel attachment method using copper-free click chemistry, where a DBCO-tagged DNA molecule is bound to an azide-functionalized surface. We use this new technique to covalently attach DNA to a flow cell surface. We show that this technique results in covalently linked tethers that are torsionally constrained and withstand very high forces ({\textgreater}100pN) in magnetic tweezers.CONCLUSIONS:This novel anchoring strategy using copper-free click chemistry allows to specifically and covalently link biomolecules, and conduct high-force single-molecule experiments. Excitingly, this advance opens up the possibility for single-molecule experiments on DNA-protein complexes and molecules that are taken directly from cell lysate.},

abstract = {To enable enhanced paper-based diagnostics with improved detection capabilities, new methods are needed to immobilize affinity reagents to porous substrates, especially for capture molecules other than IgG. To this end, we have developed and characterized three novel methods for immobilizing protein-based affinity reagents to nitrocellulose membranes. We have demonstrated these methods using recombinant affinity proteins for the influenza surface protein hemagglutinin, leveraging the customizability of these recombinant "flu binders" for the design of features for immobilization. The three approaches shown are: (1) covalent attachment of thiolated affinity protein to an epoxide-functionalized nitrocellulose membrane, (2) attachment of biotinylated affinity protein through a nitrocellulose-binding streptavidin anchor protein, and (3) fusion of affinity protein to a novel nitrocellulose-binding anchor protein for direct coupling and immobilization. We also characterized the use of direct adsorption for the flu binders, as a point of comparison and motivation for these novel methods. Finally, we demonstrated that these novel methods can provide improved performance to an influenza hemagglutinin assay, compared to a traditional antibody-based capture system. Taken together, this work advances the toolkit available for the development of next-generation paper-based diagnostics.},

abstract = {The bond lifetime-force behavior of the immunoglobulin G (IgG)-protein A interaction has been studied with magnetic tweezers to characterize the physical properties of the bond under nonequilibrium conditions. Super-paramagnetic microparticles were developed that have a high and uniform magnetization to simultaneously apply a piconewton-scale tensile force to many thousands of IgG-protein A bonds. A strong and a weak slip bond were detected with an effective bond length that is characteristic of short- range, stiff intermolecular interactions. These bonds are attributed to the interaction of protein A with the constant region (Fc) and heavy chain variable domain (VH) of IgG, respectively. The IgG-VH interaction appears to be one of the weakest specific molecular interactions that has been identified with a single molecule force measurement technique. This study demonstrates that magnetic tweezers can be used to rapidly characterize very weak biomolecular interactions as well as strong biomolecular interactions with a high degree of accuracy.},

Newly discovered members and recent biochemical and structural results are reviewed, and mechanistic implications of these results are summarized. The primary cellular functions of these enzymes, including their roles in replication, transcription, chromosome condensation, and the maintenance of genome stability, are then discussed.

In one such technique, the magnetic trap, a single DNA molecule is bound at one end to a glass surface and at the other to a magnetic microbead. Small magnets, whose position and rotation can be controlled, pull on and rotate the microbead. This provides a simple method to stretch and twist the molecule. The system allows one to apply and measure forces ranging from 10(-3) to {\textgreater}100 picoNewtons (pN). In contrast to other techniques, the force measurement is absolute and does not require calibration of the sensor. This protocol describes a procedure for building and using a magnetic trap. It gives a method for constructing a microchamber suitable for magnetic tweezers studies, including antibody coating and passivation. It also describes a series of simple steps to achieve end-labeling of DNA anchoring fragments. One anchoring fragment is biotin-labeled and the other is labeled with digoxigenin. The anchoring fragments are then digested and ligated to a central DNA region containing the sequence of interest. The biotinylated DNA is adsorbed onto streptavidin-coated magnetic beads, and the DNA-bead mixture attaches specifically to the antidigoxigenin-coated surface of the microchamber.},

@article{Lane2012,
abstract = {The overall goal of this method is to describe a technique to subject adherent cells to laminar flow conditions and evaluate their response to well quantifiable fluid shear stresses. Our flow chamber design and flow circuit (Fig. 1) contains a transparent viewing region that enables testing of cell adhesion and imaging of cell morphology immediately before flow (Fig. 11A, B), at various time points during flow (Fig. 11C), and after flow (Fig. 11D). These experiments are illustrated with human umbilical cord blood-derived endothelial progenitor cells (EPCs) and porcine EPCs. This method is also applicable to other adherent cell types, e.g. smooth muscle cells (SMCs) or fibroblasts. The chamber and all parts of the circuit are easily sterilized with steam autoclaving. In contrast to other chambers, e.g. microfluidic chambers, large numbers of cells ({\textgreater} 1 million depending on cell size) can be recovered after the flow experiment under sterile conditions for cell culture or other experiments, e.g. DNA or RNA extraction, or immunohistochemistry (Fig. 11E), or scanning electron microscopy. The shear stress can be adjusted by varying the flow rate of the perfusate, the fluid viscosity, or the channel height and width. The latter can reduce fluid volume or cell needs while ensuring that one-dimensional flow is maintained. It is not necessary to measure chamber height between experiments, since the chamber height does not depend on the use of gaskets, which greatly increases the ease of multiple experiments. Furthermore, the circuit design easily enables the collection of perfusate samples for analysis and/or quantification of metabolites secreted by cells under fluid shear stress exposure, e.g. nitric oxide (Fig. 12).},

Our apparatus allows massively parallel (100-1000) measurements on many single complexes perturbed by constant forces. Compared to other single-molecule techniques, our method is simple, inexpensive, robust, and widely compatible with other techniques. We immobilized specific receptor molecules on the surface of superparamagnetic beads and corresponding ligand molecules on a fixed surface. The beads were allowed to contact the surface so that ligand-receptor binding occurred. A permanent magnet then generated a constant force that pulled the receptors away from the ligands. The rates at which bound species separated at various forces allowed us to characterize the potential energy landscape of the bond and extrapolate bulk solution kinetic rates and transition-state distances. These values agreed with those obtained using bulk and single-molecule methods.},

The length of individual DNA molecules is used to measure the activity of single replisomes engaged in coordinated DNA replication. First, a tethered-particle technique is used to visualize the formation and release of replication loops. Second, a fluorescence imaging method provides a direct readout of replication rates and processivities from individual replisomes. The ability to directly observe transient reaction intermediates and characterize heterogeneous behavior makes these single-molecule approaches important new additions to the tools available to study DNA replication. ?? 2010 Elsevier Inc.},

We use a microscope with a low magnification, and thus a wide field of view, to visualize multiple DNA-tethered paramagnetic beads and apply an optimized image analysis routine to track the three-dimensional position of each bead simultaneously in real time. Force is applied to each bead using an externally applied magnetic field. Since variations in the field parameters are negligible across the field of view, nearly identical manipulation of all visible beads is possible. However, we find that the error in the position measurement is inversely proportional to the microscope's magnification. To mitigate the increased error caused by demagnification, we have developed a strategy based on tracking multiple fixed beads. Our system is capable of simultaneously manipulating and tracking up to 34 DNA-tethered beads at 60 Hz with approximately 1.5 nm resolution and with approximately 10{\%} variation in applied force.},

The assay combines the conventional pull-down assay with single-molecule total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy and allows the probing of single macromolecular complexes directly from cell or tissue extracts. In this method, antibodies against the protein of interest are immobilized on a passivated microscope slide. When cell extracts are applied, the surface-tethered antibody captures the protein together with its physiological interaction partners. After washing away the unbound components, single-molecule fluorescence microscopy is used to probe the pulled-down proteins. Captured proteins are visualized through genetically encoded fluorescent protein tags or through antibody labeling. Compared with western blot analysis, this ultrasensitive assay requires considerably less time and reagents and provides quantitative data. Furthermore, SiMPull can distinguish between multiple association states of the same protein. SiMPull is generally applicable to proteins from a variety of cellular contexts and to endogenous proteins. Starting with the cell extracts and passivated slides, the assay requires 1.5-2.5 h for data acquisition and analysis.},

Conse- quently, a mixed population of surface bound particles is formed with different binding natures. Magnetic field gradients are used to apply translational forces on the bound particles. Using a multicomponent dissociation analysis, we are able to make a distinction between weak nonspecific interactions, strong nonspecific interactions, and specific interactions. We validate the model by comprehensive experiments in which the biochemical components and applied forces are varied. The low-force data yield reliable values for the spontaneous dissociation rates of single-molecule specific bonds, and at high forces, the bond barriers are modified by the applied force.

Firstly, we discuss a DNA hairpin assay where force-induced strand separation triggers a tight interaction between DNA-binding protein Tus and its binding site Ter, where forces up to 90??pN for hundreds of seconds were required to dissociate Tus from Ter. Secondly, we show how the LTag helicase of Simian virus 40 unwinds dsDNA, where a load of 36??pN optimizes the assay readout. The approaches detailed here provide guidelines for the high-throughput, quantitative study of a wide range of DNA-protein interactions.},

abstract = {A simple and efficient PCR method was developed for generating dye- or radiolabeled single-stranded DNA targets or probes used for hybridization studies. The method involved the use of a pair of long primers with high annealing temperatures and a short, labeled primer with a low annealing temperature in a PCR consisting of two cycles at different temperatures. We used this method to generate dye Cy 5-labeled and [32P]-radiolabeled single-stranded DNA targets and probes. These labeled probes were used successfully for the microarray identification of point mutations in Mycobacterium tuberculosis genes and for the Northern blot detection of expression changes of the GATA-2 gene in Pneumocystis carinii-infected rat lungs.},

abstract = {This chapter aims to describe a nanomanipulation technique that makes it possible to mechanically and quantitatively stretch and supercoil a single linear DNA molecule. This chapter reviews the technique, which is an extension to the study of protein DNA interactions that leads to DNA untwisting, particularly to the study of promoter unwinding by RNA polymerase during the initiation of transcription. It discusses the response of the DNA to mechanical changes in supercoiling when calibrated, the system can be used to observe in real-time interactions between a single enzyme molecule and its supercoiled DNA substrate. It explains the application of this method in the study of RNA polymerase-induced promoter unwinding, along with bending/compaction of the DNA by RNA polymerase. With this assay, there is a possibility to quantitatively study the role of DNA sequence and supercoiling, temperature, nucleotides, effectors, and activators in formation of the transcription bubble. This technique may be applicable to the real-time study of a variety of protein–DNA interactions that cause deformation of the DNA, such as the unwinding of origins of replication or the binding of transcription factors.},

These provide simple and versatile immunofluorescence nanoprobes with nanometer accuracy and resolution. Using the new probes we tracked the walking of individual kinesin motors and measured their 8 nm step sizes; we tracked Piezo1 channels, which are eukaryotic mechanosensitive channels; we also tracked AMPA receptors on living neurons.

Herein, divinyl sulfone (DVS) chemistry was demonstrated to immobilize small molecules, proteins, and DNA covalently onto the hydroxyl groups of cellulose membranes through nucleophilic addition. Assays on modified cellulose using protein–carbohydrate and protein–glycoprotein interactions as well as oligonucleotide hybridization showed that the membrane's bioactivity was specific, dose-dependent, and stable over a long period of time. The use of an inkjet printer to form patterns of biomolecules on DVS-activated cellulose illustrates the adaptability of the DVS functionalization technique to pattern sophisticated designs, with potential applications in cellulose-...},

abstract = {Collagenases are the principal enzymes responsible for the degradation of collagens during embryonic development, wound healing, and cancer metastasis. However, the mechanism by which these enzymes disrupt the highly chemically and structurally stable collagen triple helix remains incompletely understood. We used a single-molecule magnetic tweezers assay to characterize the cleavage of heterotrimeric collagen I by both the human collagenase matrix metalloproteinase-1 (MMP-1) and collagenase from Clostridium histolyticum. We observe that the application of 16 pN of force causes an 8-fold increase in collagen proteolysis rates by MMP-1 but does not affect cleavage rates by Clostridium collagenase. Quantitative analysis of these data allows us to infer the structural changes in collagen associated with proteolytic cleavage by both enzymes. Our data support a model in which MMP-1 cuts a transient, stretched conformation of its recognition site. In contrast, our findings suggest that Clostridium collagenase is able to cleave the fully wound collagen triple helix, accounting for its lack of force sensitivity and low sequence specificity. We observe that the cleavage of heterotrimeric collagen is less force sensitive than the proteolysis of a homotrimeric collagen model peptide, consistent with studies suggesting that the MMP-1 recognition site in heterotrimeric collagen I is partially unwound at equilibrium.},

abstract = {The labeling of biomolecules has become standard practice in molecular biosciences. Modifications are used for detection, sorting and isolation of small molecules, complexes and entire cells. We have recently reported a method for introducing internal chemical and structural modifications into kbp-sized DNA target substrates that are frequently used in single-molecule experiments. It makes use of nicking enzymes that create single-stranded DNA gaps, which can be subsequently filled with labeled oligonucleotides. Here we provide a detailed protocol and further expand this method. We show that modifications can be introduced at distant loci within one molecule in a simple one-pot reaction. In addition, we achieve labeling on both strands at a specific locus, as demonstrated by Forster resonance energy transfer (FRET) experiments. The protocol requires an initial cloning of the target substrate (3-5 d), whereas the labeling itself takes 4-6 h. More elaborate purification and verification of label incorporation requires 2 h for each method.},
