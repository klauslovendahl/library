	Abstract = {Crystallization chaperones have been used to facilitate the crystallization of challenging proteins. Even though the maltose-binding protein (MBP) is one of the most commonly used crystallization chaperones, the design of optimal expression constructs for crystallization of MBP fusion proteins remains a challenge. To increase the success rate of MBP-facilitated crystallization, a series of expression vectors have been designed with either a short flexible linker or a set of rigid helical linkers. Seven death domain superfamily members were tested for crystallization with this set of vectors, six of which had never been crystallized before. All of the seven targets were crystallized, and their structures were determined using at least one of the vectors. Our successful crystallization of all of the targets demonstrates the validity of our approach and expands the arsenal of the crystallization chaperone toolkit, which may be applicable to crystallization of other difficult protein targets, as well as to other crystallization chaperones.},

	Abstract = {Proteins are commonly fused to Escherichia coli maltose-binding protein (MBP) to enhance their yield and facilitate their purification. In addition, the stability and solubility of a passenger protein can often be improved by fusing it to MBP. In a previous comparison with two other highly soluble fusion partners, MBP was decidedly superior at promoting the solubility of a range of aggregation-prone proteins. To explain this observation, we proposed that MBP could function as a general molecular chaperone in the context of a fusion protein by binding to aggregation-prone folding intermediates of passenger proteins and preventing their self-association. The ligand-binding cleft in MBP was considered a likely site for peptide binding because of its hydrophobic nature. We tested this hypothesis by systematically replacing hydrophobic amino acid side chains in and around the cleft with glutamic acid. None of these mutations affected the yield or solubility of MBP in its unfused state. Each MBP was then tested for its ability to promote solubility when fused to three passenger proteins: green fluorescent protein, p16, and E6. Mutations within the maltose-binding cleft (W62E, A63E, Y155E, W230E, and W340E) had little or no effect on the solubility of the fusion proteins. In contrast, three mutations near one end of the cleft (W232E, Y242E, and I317E) dramatically reduced the solubility of the same fusion proteins. The mutations with the most profound effect on solubility were shown to reduce the global stability of MBP.},

@article{Raran-Kurussi_2012,
	Abstract = {Escherichia coli maltose binding protein (MBP) is commonly used to promote the solubility of its fusion partners. To investigate the mechanism of solubility enhancement by MBP, we compared the properties of MBP fusion proteins refolded in vitro with those of the corresponding fusion proteins purified under native conditions. We fused five aggregation-prone passenger proteins to 3 different N-terminal tags: His6-MBP, His6-GST and His6. After purifying the 15 fusion proteins under denaturing conditions and refolding them by rapid dilution, we recovered far more of the soluble MBP fusion proteins than their GST- or His-tagged counterparts. Hence, we can reproduce the solubilizing activity of MBP in a simple in vitro system, indicating that no additional factors are required to mediate this effect. We assayed both the soluble fusion proteins and their TEV protease digestion products (i.e., with the N-terminal tag removed) for biological activity. Little or no activity was detected for some fusion proteins whereas others were quite active. When the MBP fusions proteins were purified from E. coli under native conditions they were all substantially active. These results indicate that the ability of MBP to promote the solubility of its fusion partners in vitro sometimes, but not always, results in their proper folding. We show that the folding of some passenger proteins is mediated by endogenous chaperones in vivo. Hence, MBP serves as a passive participant in the folding process; passenger proteins either fold spontaneously or with the assistance of chaperones.},

@article{Kapust_1999,
	Abstract = {Although it is usually possible to achieve a favorable yield of a recombinant protein in Escherichia coli, obtaining the protein in a soluble, biologically active form continues to be a major challenge. Sometimes this problem can be overcome by fusing an aggregation-prone polypeptide to a highly soluble partner. To study this phenomenon in greater detail, we compared the ability of three soluble fusion partners---maltose-binding protein (MBP), glutathione S-transferase (GST), and thioredoxin (TRX)---to inhibit the aggregation of six diverse proteins that normally accumulate in an insoluble form. Remarkably, we found that MBP is a far more effective solubilizing agent than the other two fusion partners. Moreover, we demonstrated that in some cases fusion to MBP can promote the proper folding of the attached protein into its biologically active conformation. Thus, MBP seems to be capable of functioning as a general molecular chaperone in the context of a fusion protein. A model is proposed to explain how MBP promotes the solubility and influences the folding of its fusion partners.},

Crystals could not be obtained with a MBP/gp21 fusion protein in which fusion partners were separated by a flexible linker, but were obtained after connecting the MBP C-terminal α-helix to the predicted N-terminal α-helical sequence of gp21 via three alanine residues. The gp21 sequences conferred a trimeric structure to the soluble fusion proteins as assessed by sedimentation equilibrium and X-ray diffraction, consistent with the trimeric structures of other retroviral transmembrane proteins. The envelope protein precursor, gp62, is likewise trimeric when expressed in mammalian cells.

In common with other periplasmic proteins, it is extremely protease resistant, and it can fold properly in both the cytoplasmic and periplasmic compartments. It binds a variety of glucose-14-glucose polysaccharides, from maltose and longer chain maltodextrins to -cyclodextrin. Upon binding its ligand, it undergoes a large conformational change. These properties have made MBP attractive for a number of engineering studies that have elucidated its role in maltodextrin transport, tuned its properties as an affinity and solubility tag, and transformed it into an allosteric effector or a biosensor for both its natural ligand and for compounds as varied as zinc and TNT (Marvin & Hellinga, 2001, Naal et al., 2002, Wu et al., 1997).},

In this study, MalE was produced in Spodoptera frugiperda (Sf9) lepidopterian cells using the baculovirus expression system. The secretion of MalE, following cleavage of its signal sequence, to the supernatant fluid of recombinant baculovirus-infected Sf9 cells and its affinity for maltodextrin polymers allowed recovery of significant amounts (> or = 10 micrograms per 10(6) cells) of highly purified protein. The gene encoding the envelope glycoprotein E of the dengue (DEN) type 2 virus deleted of its C-terminal 102 amino acids (D2E delta 102) was fused to the MalE gene. The resulting hybrid MalE-D2E delta 102 glycoprotein was processed through the Golgi network of Sf9 cells and was secreted. It was retained on a maltodextrin column and was eluted with maltose. Antigenic and immunogenic properties dependent on the three-dimensional structure in the native E protein were preserved in the recombinant MalE-D2E delta 102 protein. Thus MalE with its signal sequence may be used as a carrier protein for production in the baculovirus system and purification of proteins which require transportation through intracellular compartments for correct folding and processing.},

We isolated mutations in MBP that enhance binding to maltodextrins 1.3 to 15-fold, using random mutagenesis followed by screening for enhanced yield in a microplate- based affinity purification. We tested the mutations for their ability to enhance the yield of a fusion protein that binds poorly to immobilized amylose and their ability to enhance the solubility of one or more aggregation-prone recombinant proteins. We also measured dissociation constants of the mutant MBPs that retain the solubility-enhancing properties of MBP and combined two of the mutations to produce an MBP with a dissociation constant 10-fold tighter than wild- type MBP. Some of the mutations we obtained can be rationalized based on the previous work, while others indicate new ways in which the function of MBP can be modified.},

Using this cell type-independent approach, we could increase the expression of secreted and intracellular human proteins up to 200-fold. By molecular replacement with MBP, we readily determined five novel high-resolution structures of rigid fusions of targets that otherwise defied crystallization.},

	Abstract = {The affinity of maltose-binding protein (MBP) for maltose and related carbohydrates was greatly in- creased by removal of groups in the interface opposite the ligand binding cleft. The wild-type protein has a KD of 1200 nM for maltose; mutation of residues Met-321 and Gln-325, both to alanine, resulted in a KD for malt- ose of 70 nM; deletion of 4 residues, Glu-172, Asn-173, Lys-175, and Tyr-176, which are part of a poorly or- dered loop, results in a KD for maltose of 110 nM. Com- bining the mutations yields an increased affinity for maltodextrins and a KD of 6 nM for maltotriose. Com- parison of ligand binding by the mutants, using sur- face plasmon resonance spectroscopy, indicates that decreases in the off-rate are responsible for the in- creased affinity. Small-angle x-ray scattering was used to demonstrate that the mutations do not significantly affect the solution conformation of MBP in either the presence or absence of maltose. The crystal structures of selected mutants showed that the mutations do not cause significant structural changes in either the closed or open conformation of MBP. These studies show that interactions in the interface opposite the ligand binding cleft, which we term the ``balancing interface,'' are responsible for modulating the affinity of MBP for its ligand. Our results are consistent with a model in which the ligand-bound protein alternates between the closed and open conformations, and re- moval of interactions in the balancing interface de- creases the stability of the open conformation, without affecting the closed conformation.},

	Abstract = {Recombinant proteins are commonly expressed in eukaryotic expression systems to ensure the formation of disulfide bridges and proper glycosylation. Although many proteins can be expressed easily, some proteins, sub-domains, and mutant protein versions can cause problems. Here, we investigated expression levels of recombinant extracellular, intracellular as well as transmembrane proteins tethered to different polypeptides in mam- malian cell lines. Strikingly, fusion of proteins to the prokaryotic maltose-binding protein (MBP) generally enhanced protein production. MBP fusion proteins consistently exhibited the most robust increase in protein production in comparison to commonly used tags, e.g., the Fc, Glutathione S-transferase (GST), SlyD, and serum albumin (ser alb) tag. Moreover, proteins tethered to MBP revealed reduced numbers of dying cells upon transient transfec- tion. In contrast to the Fc tag, MBP is a stable monomer and does not promote protein aggregation. Therefore, the MBP tag does not induce artificial dimerization of tethered pro- teins and provides a beneficial fusion tag for binding as well as cell adhesion studies. Using MBP we were able to secret a disease causing laminin β2 mutant protein (congenital nephrotic syndrome), which is normally retained in the endoplasmic reticulum. In summary, this study establishes MBP as a versatile expression tag for protein production in eukaryotic expression systems.},

	Abstract = {Combining the concepts of synthetic symmetrization with the approach of engineering metal-binding sites, we have developed a new crystallization methodology termed metal-mediated synthetic symmetrization. In this method, pairs of histidine or cysteine mutations are introduced on the surface of target proteins, generating crystal lattice contacts or oligomeric assemblies upon coordination with metal. Metal-mediated synthetic symmetrization greatly expands the packing and oligomeric assembly possibilities of target proteins, thereby increasing the chances of growing diffraction-quality crystals. To demonstrate this method, we designed various T4 lysozyme (T4L) and maltose-binding protein (MBP) mutants and cocrystallized them with one of three metal ions: copper (Cu21), nickel (Ni21), or zinc (Zn21). The approach resulted in 16 new crystal structures---eight for T4L and eight for MBP---displaying a variety of oligomeric assemblies and packing modes, representing in total 13 new and distinct crystal forms for these proteins. We discuss the potential utility of the method for crystallizing target proteins of unknown structure by engineering in pairs of histidine or cysteine residues. As an alternate strategy, we propose that the varied crystallization-prone forms of T4L or MBP engineered in this work could be used as crystallization chaperones, by fusing them genetically to target proteins of interest.},

	Abstract = {Protein crystallographers are often confronted with recalcitrant proteins not readily crystallizable, or which crystallize in problematic forms. A variety of techniques have been used to surmount such obstacles: crystallization using carrier proteins or antibody complexes, chemical modification, surface entropy reduction, proteolytic digestion, and additive screening. Here we present a synergistic approach for successful crystallization of proteins that do not form diffraction quality crystals using conventional methods. This approach combines favorable aspects of carrier-driven crystallization with surface entropy reduction. We have generated a series of maltose binding protein (MBP) fusion constructs containing different surface mutations designed to reduce surface entropy and encourage crystal lattice formation. The MBP advantageously increases protein expression and solubility, and provides a streamlined purification protocol. Using this technique, we have successfully solved the structures of three unrelated proteins that were previously unattainable. This crystallization technique represents a valuable rescue strategy for protein structure solution when conventional methods fail.},

	Abstract = {Species-specific recognition between the egg extracellular matrix (zona pellucida) and sperm is the first, crucial step of mammalian fertilization1. Zona pellucida filament components ZP3 and ZP2 act as sperm receptors, and mice lacking either of the correspond- ing genes produce oocytes without a zona pellucida and are com- pletely infertile2. Like their counterparts in the vitelline envelope of non-mammalian eggs and many other secreted eukaryotic pro- teins, zona pellucida subunits polymerize using a `zona pellucida (ZP) domain' module3--5, whose conserved amino-terminal part (ZP-N) was suggested to constitute a domain of its own6. No atomic structure has been reported for ZP domain proteins, and there is no structural information on any conserved vertebrate protein that is essential for fertilization and directly involved in egg--sperm binding. Here we describe the 2.3 a ̊ ngstro ̈ m (A ̊ ) reso- lution structure of the ZP-N fragment of mouse primary sperm receptor ZP3. The ZP-N fold defines a new immunoglobulin superfamily subtype with a b-sheet extension characterized by an E9 strand and an invariant tyrosine residue implicated in poly- merization. The structure strongly supports the presence of ZP-N repeats within the N-terminal region of ZP2 and other vertebrate zona pellucida/vitelline envelope proteins, with implications for overall egg coat architecture, the post-fertilization block to poly- spermy and speciation. Moreover, it provides an important framework for understanding human diseases caused by muta- tions in ZP domain proteins and developing new methods of non-hormonal contraception.},

	Abstract = {Uromodulin (UMOD)/Tamm--Horsfall protein, the most abundant human urinary protein, plays a key role in chronic kidney diseases and is a promising therapeutic target for hypertension. Via its bi- partite zona pellucida module (ZP-N/ZP-C), UMOD forms extracellu- lar filaments that regulate kidney electrolyte balance and innate immunity, as well as protect against renal stones. Moreover, salt- dependent aggregation of UMOD filaments in the urine generates a soluble molecular net that captures uropathogenic bacteria and facilitates their clearance. Despite the functional importance of its homopolymers, no structural information is available on UMOD and how it self-assembles into filaments. Here, we report the crystal structures of polymerization regions of human UMOD and mouse ZP2, an essential sperm receptor protein that is structurally related to UMOD but forms heteropolymers. The structure of UMOD reveals that an extensive hydrophobic interface mediates ZP-N domain homodimerization. This arrangement is required for filament forma- tion and is directed by an ordered ZP-N/ZP-C linker that is not ob- served in ZP2 but is conserved in the sequence of deafness/Crohn's disease-associated homopolymeric glycoproteins α-tectorin (TECTA) and glycoprotein 2 (GP2). Our data provide an example of how interdomain linker plasticity can modulate the function of structur- ally similar multidomain proteins. Moreover, the architecture of UMOD rationalizes numerous pathogenic mutations in both UMOD and TECTA genes.},

	Abstract = {Fusion proteins can be used directly in protein crystallization to assist crystallization in at least two different ways. In one approach, the `heterologous fusion-protein approach', the fusion partner can provide additional surface area to promote crystal contact formation. In another approach, the `fusion of interacting proteins approach', protein assemblies can be stabilized by covalently linking the interacting partners. The linker connecting the proteins plays different roles in the two applications: in the first approach a rigid linker is required to reduce conformational heterogeneity; in the second, conversely, a flexible linker is required that allows the native interaction between the fused proteins. The two approaches can also be combined. The recent applications of fusion-protein technology in protein crystallization from the work of our own and other laboratories are briefly reviewed.},

@article{Waugh_2016,
	Abstract = { Although chaperone-assisted protein crystallization remains a comparatively rare under- taking, the number of crystal structures of polypeptides fused to maltose-binding protein (MBP) that have been deposited in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) has grown dramatically during the past decade. Altogether, 102 fusion protein structures were detected by Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) analysis. Collectively, these structures comprise a range of sizes, space groups, and resolutions that are typical of the PDB as a whole. While most of these MBP fusion proteins were equipped with short inter-domain linkers to increase their rigidity, fusion proteins with long linkers have also been crystallized. In some cases, surface entropy reduction mutations in MBP appear to have facilitated the formation of crystals. A comparison of the structures of fused and unfused pro- teins, where both are available, reveals that MBP-mediated structural distortions are very rare.},
